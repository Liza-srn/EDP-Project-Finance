## **Project Structure**

### **1. Black-Scholes Model**  
Used for valuing European options, this model simulates the evolution of option prices over time based on the underlying asset price, volatility, and the risk-free rate.

### **2. CIR Model**  
This model describes the evolution of interest rates while accounting for stochastic characteristics such as volatility and mean reversion.

### **3. Vasicek Model**  
Another model for interest rates, based on an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, allowing for a more simplified and symmetric analysis of numerical errors.
